Weather Based Activity Suggestion App: 

This Flask application takes a user's location and suggests activities to them based on the weather in their current area (which is obtained using OpenWeather API). The user enters their current city and state and a list of potential activites is generated based on the real time weather conditions in their current location. For example if it is snowing in the user's current location, the app will suggest activites such as skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, and ice skating. If it is windy the applicaiton will suggest kiteboarding, windsurfing, paragliding ect.
